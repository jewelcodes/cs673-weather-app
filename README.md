# Weather app for MET CS 673
This is the first part of assignment 4 for MET CS 673 - Software Engineering taken in spring 2024. It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) as suggested in the assignment instructions. 

I also figured this was an opportunity to learn React and actually build something with it, so I did this assignment in TypeScript. A demo is available at [https://weather.jewelcodes.io/](https://weather.jewelcodes.io/), with the UI heavily inspired by Apple's weather app.

The actual API fetch code is in `src/common/now.ts` and `src/common/forecast.ts`.
